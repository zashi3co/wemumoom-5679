The author has made substantial changes to the text in order to streamline it, to state more clearly what he is doing, and to connect it to recent debates in moral philosophy. An elaboration of KafkaÂ´s "philosophy" has been added. Most of these changes are helpful, but do not adress the central problems in the previous version. There is still too much going on in the text, too many contrasts, too many heterogeneus positions to be fited int such a short text. Thus the author fails to make a credible case for the staged dialogue between Strawson, Kafka and Foucault. Is it really the case that the latter would deny what the former claims (e.g. that moral judgments are "participant attitudes" and that this is something fundamental for humans (and for what we mean by morality)). Are they not concerned with rather differnet things: e.g. the historical forms and practices in which such attitudes are shaped (Foucault) or the loss of moral coherence and meaningful authority in modernity (Kafka)?

The interpretive issues concerning Foucault in the previous version remain. The author has added a few obstervations on Foucault, but still claims that Foucault's historical take undermines morality. His work does indeed have implications for the possibility of ahistoricla moral truths. But this does not necessarily place him at odds with Strawson, whose problematization is quite different, emerging form the analytic philosophers' insistent concern for objectivity.

Thus there is much more proper philosophical work to be done for by the author to make this work. No mere revision of the text will fix the current problems.
